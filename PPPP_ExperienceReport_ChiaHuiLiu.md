## Peer Production Participation Project: experience report

### Before Participation
As a programming-based peer production community, Open Austin serves a good role in encouraging people interested in contributing to the projects. During this semester, I joined Open Austin and talked with a couple of people in different projects. Overall speaking, Open Austin has built a well-structured framework with detailed guidelines to recommend people to follow to get a full picture of how open-sourced projects work in the organization. However, to successfully contribute to the projects, some technical knowledge such as basic commands of GitHub and programming skills are prerequisites for people who would like to contribute to projects in Open Austin.

### Participation Experience
Different projects are usually initialized by different contributors. During the semester, I participated two projects in Open Austin, which are [voters visualization](https://github.com/Legitblock/voter-visualizations) and [name a stray](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues/123). Before you contributing to the projects, Open Austin requires every participant read the [Influence TX Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZj11BGqwX5IR3EbeIRih1Up5PT_nna3gX8lwXXrDTY/edit). Participants are welcome to choose any of the on-going projects listed on the [GitHub](https://github.com/open-austin) of Open Austin. At the very first, I reached out the project initializers by replying an issue on GitHub separately for the two projects. 

In the former project, I received Josh’s reply in short time and I started working on the code according to my interests. In the end, I finished solving the encoding bug and plotted a pie chart to visualize the portion of registered voters by gender, and the code changes were accepted by Josh after I created pull requests on the GitHub. The data of registered voters are released as open data by the Austin government. Overall speaking, the experience of participation was great as Josh and I actually communicated frequently and he helped me a lot in understanding the project. In addition, he replied to me by emails or pull requests shortly, and this is one of the main reason drives me to keep contributing. Although I went to one of the meet-ups held by Open Austin, I didn’t see Jon in person, but this won’t keep me from contributing to the project as it makes me build a sense of accomplishment and the feeling of being valued.

However, the later project didn’t make me feel in the same way as the former one. After I reached the project initializers out, the only thing I got from them is silence. The experience gained from the later project makes me rethink about the importance of the motivations and the governance in terms of peer production. To me, the personal motivations are not the only sources motivating participants, the external circumstances do motivate them or de-motivate them.

### Implications
Compared to the expectation I mentioned in the first paper, I think the voter-registration visualization meet the criteria of peer production and my expectation, including the way of contribution, the communication with other participants. Without a doubt, the project is released under Unliscense, which meets the denotation of peer production as well. On the other hand, the other project, name a stray, didn’t work effectively. However, it makes me rethink why the criteria of peer production play an important role and have more concrete ideas about the basis of peer production projects.
